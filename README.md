## IS AN UNHACKABLE SYSTEM A DREAM

As the time progressed, technology progressed along with it. There were instances where
we thought that tech reached saturation but in each one of those darkest moments, inventions were
invented that caused a BIG BANG and rippled through all the disciplines of science. New
possibilities were unlocked, what old school scientists dreamed started to take shape. Dreams
turned to reality. A few inventions like that are computers, transistors, optical fiber. One of the
ripples that invention of optical fiber caused is Optical fiber Communication.

Optical fiber communication enables communication over long distances (coast to coast)
with bit rates of 1000 Gbit/S [1]. With data transfer rates like that these and using multiple
servers/memory drives to store the data (Cloud Storage). The Consumption of data is ever
growing, so the need for privacy is even more especially when our personal data is being store
somewhere else. The encryption algorithms are getting better by day but, people who want to
hack/eavesdrop the data also have access to the same technology which is used to design the
algorithm in the first place. I.e., as long as the design of encryption/decryption algorithm depends
on mathematical/Computational/predictable methods there is always a threat to the privacy and the
integrity of data.

Imagine a few scenarios- To get an abstract picture of our current situations regarding the
privacy/integrity of data and the scenarios of what might happen if they are hacked/breached.

### Hacking an autonomous System:

Most people love tesla cars because of their self-driving ability, these cars often get
software updates, the software is updated via internet (Wi-Fi). Let us assume this scenario- A
hacker plants a bug in the ‘software update’ which gives him back access to update the software.
So now hacker can upload his own program, there are two worst possible cases that could happen
0O98P;POI
- The hacker has complete control over all Tesla vehicles and can launch a terrorist attack using them. It is comparable to having countless millions of missiles at the ready. Imagine how terrifying it would be if all the cars started crashing into people and structures at once. Hundreds of cars might be crashing into police stations at once, and since they have powerful batteries, they could even be used as explosives.

These days' modern homes include sophisticated central monitoring systems that enable remote control of practically everything in the home. Although we may assume that these systems are quite dependable, they are actually quite vulnerable to competent hackers. Suppose that a hacker gains access to your central monitoring system.

- The hacker has the ability to listen in on every conversation and even set homes on fire (because he has access to Gas and electricity).
- Let's assume that every home had this technology in 100 years. If a hacker were to cause even half of the country's electric appliances to shut off at once, the entire country would go dark for several days.
- The power producing facilities would experience a blackout due to the severe drop in load, and it would take several days to weeks to restore things to normal. The electric system would also sustain significant damage.

7,941 satellites orbit our planet at the moment. [2] and "Up to this point, SpaceX has launched 1,740 Starlin satellites; the company will start launching its first-generation system in November 2019. In total, Gen2 is expected to include close to 30,000 satellites. [3]. It is not as difficult to hack a satellite as people believe; all you need is $300 in equipment and a competent hacker [4].

- A few satellites can be hacked to start a chain of collisions that could result in a global communication blackout. Satellites can also be used as missiles to bring down objects on Earth.

We can infer from the aforementioned possibilities that we require an unhackable system, and researchers have developed a system that can do just that. It is known as the "Quantum Internet." Quantum computing that utilize quantum phenomena to address enormous challenges are touted as the direction of computing. The United States Department of Energy has released a roadmap outlining research objectives and technical obstacles in the way of a quantum internet, which is really in the works.

Although we have been working on it for the past ten years, it can be difficult to characterize "quantum internet." There are a few methods to do it, but there is no clear definition beyond "sending quantum signals back and forth." Probably the approach A quantum channel would be extremely challenging to eavesdrop on. By using entanglement, another quantum phenomenon, it might be made even more challenging.

After an interaction, particles or quantum systems are connected if they become entangled. You can determine the state of the other by knowing the state of the first. And when one changes, the other immediately changes as well. This implies that communication might be possible across extremely long distances and maybe at a speed faster than light. Additionally, since nothing is transmitted across a wire, the message cannot be tampered with. But first, there is the problem of moving the entangled particles to their proper locations. Once they start interacting, they must still be kept apart. The methods used to do this currently But at the moment, the photons produced during entanglement are at wavelengths that quickly deteriorate in optical fibers. Fortunately, researchers have discovered that they may be transformed utilizing.

Using this method, scientists have successfully built up entangled nodes 50 kilometers apart by adjusting lasers to more suited wavelengths. Four important milestones are outlined in the Department of Energy's most recent vision for a quantum internet in the United States. The first is to ensure that quantum information delivered over existing fiber optic connections is secure. Creating complex networks across universities or cities, then between states, and lastly throughout the entire country. The Department of Energy reported in February 2020 that it had sent two entangled photons over two distinct 42-kilometer fiber optic loops and had confirmed they were. However, that is still a ways off. A prototype is expected within the next ten years, according to the Department of Energy. Never expect to connect to the quantum 'net, not even when everything is set up. Barring whatever the data you provide must be extremely secure [5].

But will our system really be impenetrable, or is this all just a dream? As long as we work to create systems that are impenetrable, other individuals will have access to the same or even more advanced technologies. Humans constantly strive to get better. We create things, break them to see where they fall short, and then do it again. Hopefully, the dream of complete security and an unhackable system will come true eventually.
